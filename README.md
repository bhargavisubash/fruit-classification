# Fruit-Classification #
This is a project to classify the fruits using classification algorithms like KNN, SVM, Decision Trees, etc.

### The following fruits are *classified* ###
  - apple
  - orange
  - lemon
  
### The dataset used here is from kaggle ###
The dataset contained details like mass,colour,width,height of apple,lemon,orange. The dataset contains 55 rows and 5 columns.

We have used 75% of the dataset for training the model and 25% of the dataset for testing the model

### The **Algorithms** used here are ###
#### 1. KNN or K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm. ####
 When this algorithm was applied on the dataset the accuracy produced by the model was approximately around 85% (when k is betwenn 1 to 9)
#### 2. SVM or Support Vector Machine ####
When this algorithm was applied on the dataset the accuracy produced by the model was 100%
